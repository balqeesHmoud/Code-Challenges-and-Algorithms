# Graph:

## Challenge03 - strongly connected:

Extend your graph class and add a method that takes a directed grapgh, Check if it is strongly connected or not.

<strong>Hint: A directed graph is said to be strongly connected if every vertex is reachable from every other vertex.</strong>

&nbsp;

## Example 1:
  
![](/assets/graph/graphConnected1.jpg)

Input
<pre> numbers = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5],[5,6],[6,4],[1,7],[7,3]]</pre>



Output:
```python
Not strongly connected 
```
<br>

## Example 2:
![](/assets/graph/graphConnected2.jpg)

Input
<pre> numbers = [[1,2],[1,0],[0,4],[4,3],[3,2],[3,1],[2,1],[2,4]]</pre>



Output:
```python
 Strongly connected 
```

## Instruction:

### Language: `JavaScript`:

* Create a branch called `stronglyConnected`.
* Run this command to pull the code challenge question: `npm run pull-challenge graph 03`
* Navigate to the challenge folder: `code-challenges/graph/challenge03`
* Write your solution in `challenge03.js` file.
* Write your tests in `challenge03.test.js` file.
* Document your work along with an image of your whiteboard in the `whiteboard.md` file.
* To run your test: `npm test`

## Language: `Python`:

* Create a branch called `stronglyConnected`.
* Run this command to pull the code challenge question: `python pull.py graph 03`
* Navigate to the challenge folder: `code_challenges/graph/challenge03`
* Write your solution in `challenge03.py` file.
* Write your tests in `test_challenge03.py` file.
* Document your work along with an image of your whiteboard in the `whiteboard.md` file.
* To run your test: `pytest`

## Language: `Java`:

* Create a branch called `stronglyConnected`.
* Run this command to pull the code challenge question: `npm run pull-challenge graph 03`
* Navigate to the challenge folder: `code-challenges/graph/challenge03`
* Write your solution in `App.java` file.
* Write your tests in `AppTest.java` file.
* Document your work along with an image of your whiteboard in the `whiteboard.md` file.
* To run your test: `gradle test`

## Submission:
* ACP your work once you are done.
* Create a pull request from your branch to the `main` branch
* Copy the link to your open pull request and paste it into the assignment submission field.
* Leave a description of how long this assignment took you in the comments box.
* Add any additional comments to your grader about your process or any difficulties you may have had with the assignment.
* Merge your branch into main, and delete your branch (don't worry, the PR link will still work).
